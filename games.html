					<p>This game is an open world, sandbox game that generates random servers. 
					This game features a survival mode, where you need to mine for materials, build shelters, and fight off monsters that come at night.

							<h3>5 reasons why this game is my favorite:

							<li> Its a cool way to test your creativity.</li>
